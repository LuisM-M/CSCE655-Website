   <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

   <p> Howdy! My name is Luis Martinez Morales. 
    <em> I am a Computer Science major pursuing a non-thesis master's degree.</em>
    This is my second semester taking graduate courses. 
    While I don't conduct research, I am interested in topics such as robotics and machine learning. 
    I live in Austin, Texas, but I have also lived in Massachusetts. 
    I was born in Mexico City and visit family there from time to time. </p>
    <p>As an undergraduate, I was involved in various clubs and organizations, including Latino Males United, Aggies Create, TAMU Datathon, and Aggie Hispanics in Computing. 
        Additionally, I enjoy watching TV shows on Apple TV, Netflix, and Disney Plus. 
        I also have a passion for photography and videography, especially when using older cameras.</p>

    <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility Interests</h2>

    <p>I am interested in various fields within accessibility. 
        First, I believe that communication is a key element of everyday life. 
        <strong>One aspect of accessibility that particularly catches my attention is language barriers.  </strong> 
        I think it's important to be able to visit different countries and communicate effectively with others, as it fosters a deeper understanding and stronger connections with more people.
         One fascinating technology I discovered is Vasco, a device that allows users to understand up to 112 languages. 
         It can translate photos, text, and even audio recordings, making communication across languages more accessible. </p>

    <p> Another area that interests me is accessible technology, which <em> enables </em> people with different abilities to <em> share </em> the same experiences.
         One of the most impressive innovations I've seen in gaming is the Xbox Adaptive Controller. 
         This device allows users to customize a variety of buttons and inputs, replacing the standard Xbox controller to better suit individual needs.
          Another remarkable piece of technology is the chorded keyboard, which enables users to type using a single hand by pressing a sequence of key combinations (or "chords") to produce all the characters on a standard keyboard. </p>
